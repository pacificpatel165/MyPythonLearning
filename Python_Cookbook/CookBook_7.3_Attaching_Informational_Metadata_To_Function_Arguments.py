"""
Problem
Youâ€™ve written a function, but would like to attach some additional information to the
arguments so that others know more about how a function is supposed to be used.
"""

# Solution
# Function argument annotations can be a useful way to give programmers hints about
# how a function is supposed to be used. For example, consider the following annotated
# function:

def add(x:int, y:int) -> int:
    return x + y

print(help(add))

print(add.__annotations__)
